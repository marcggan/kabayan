    About Us
    <br />
    <p>Kabayan started by building two small fan cottages and a pavilion. 
    Not long after, demand for more cottages grew not only from private 
    individuals but from corporate clients as well. Now, Kabayan Beach Resort
        boasts of 19 well-appointed air-conditioned cottages and a multi-purpose hall for 
        social and corporate requirements such as parties, weddings, seminars, and the like.</p>

    <p>Kabayan Beach Resort is a pioneer in many ways. 
    They were the very first resort built along the white sand beach of Laiya, 
    San Juan Batangas. When others followed and built fan cottages as well, 
    Kabayan upgraded their cottages and built air-conditioned ones. Soon after, 
    others followed suit. Still, Kabayan managed to come up with services and amenities 
    that are uniquely theirs —a few of which are: KTV rooms, a television set with 
    cable service at the pavilion and in all of the cottages, a chapel with anticipated 
    mass every Saturday, dormitories and a multi-purpose hall for seminars, a beach side bar, 
    and a swimming pool for adults and children. 
    Needless to say, Kabayan Beach Resort constantly strives to establish better standards of 
    products and service—all for the continued satisfaction of their guests.</p>
